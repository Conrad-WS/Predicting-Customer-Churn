        "Hello and welcome to this online notebook. You may think of it as an interactive article. \n",
        "\n",
        "What we have here is an exercise to try and understand how we can use Machine Learning to predict whether or not a customer is about to leave your company (otherwise known as **Churn**). This tutorial is aimed at non-technical people and is meant to be straightforward to follow. I hope to show that these predictive tools are accessible to everyone and anyone who owns a laptop. No prior knowledge of Machine Learning is required. Therefore, these tools can be just as useful to big corporates as to budding entrepreneurs. Everyone should be using these tools to optimize their business development decisions, simple as.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the purpose of this exercise, we are  going to use a dataset from the telecom giant **Telco** to predict if one of their customers is about to cruelly, cold-heartedly leave them for a competitor.The dataset is comprised of more than 7000 different customer profiles. For each customer, we have a set of different type of information ( in this case **21 columns**) and we will try to use these different sets of information as indicators of whether customer left the company or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine this to be historical data taken from the customer database from last quarter or last year's data as typically corporations would  have a dataset like this comprised of a few million these customer profiles (so today's dataset is tiny in comparison but it will serve nicely as a quick illustration).\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the learning model has figured out the key predictors , we can then use this model on our current customers to find out which one of them is likely to leave us soon. Learning from the past to predict the future. That's all we are doing here and that's all we will ever do in Machine Learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "So first of all, why would we want to predict customer churn? There are lots of obvious reasons: for example, if you know that a customer is likely to churn but hasn't done so yet then you might want to offer them a promotion or give them a temporary discount to stop them from doing so. Or if they are calling customer service and you see from their data that they are likely to churn, then you might want to give them special customer service attention or offer them some extra benefits.\n",
        "\n",
        "So I believe that the use cases here are clearly numerous and I think this is a really good place to start if you were a company and you wanted to play around with some Machine Learning. Predicting the churn rate is quite easy to do ( as I hope to show here) , nonetheless, it will bring instant value to your company.\n",

        "These are the three parts of our exercise :\n",
        "* **Part 1- Data Cleaning** Formatting the data so that our predictive algorithm can understand it.\n",
        "* **Part 2- Data Learning** We give the data to our algorithm for it to learn from it, find the hidden patterns and make accurate predictions.\n",
        "* **Part 3- Data Predicting** We use our now trained model to make predictions on our current customers and take the corresponding action.\n",

That, unfortunately, doesn't make any sense, we have a ranking problem. In fact, we don't want rank, we only want to differentiate. So how can we represent these values without implying that one is greater than the other?\n",

So from the column **['InternetService']**, we are going to create three new columns : **['InternetService-FiberOptic'], ['InternetService-DSL'], ['InternetService-NoInternet']**. Each column will either have  a **1** or **0**. So if our customer has DSL Internet, as is the case with the customer ***7590-VHVEG***  in our first row , then our three new columns will look like this in the first row:\n",

If the importance of the column is below 0.05, then we can conclude that the **Decision Tree** deems this column completely useless. So we will now check the feature importance of the columns that we had singled out as having no correlation in the previous step. Here they are with their feature importance coefficient:\n",

        "First of all, let's define some useful vocabulary. This will help us to understand how well our model is performing. There are four types of predictions that our model could make: **True Positive**, **False Positive, **True Negative**, **False Negative**. Let's define these terms:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **True Positive**: This is a good prediction, our model predicted that the customer was going to churn (emitted a **1**) and the customer did in reality churn (churn=**1**).\n",
        "\n",
        "* **False Positive**: This is an incorrect prediction, our model predicted that our customer churned ( emitted a **1**), however it turns out that customer did not in fact churn (churn=**0**)\n",
        "\n",
        "* **True Negative** : This is again a correct prediction, our model said that the customer **was not** going to churn ( it emitted a **0**) and this turned out to be correct in the real world ( churn was equal to **0**)\n",
        "\n",
        "* **False Negative**: Again, this is an incorrect prediction, but of a different kind. Here our model predicted that the customer was not going to churn (emitted a **0**), but lo and behold, in reality our customer did in fact leave the company (churn=**1**)\n",
        "\n",
        "With this now clearly defined, we need to decide what evaluation metric we will use to evaluate our model.\n",
        "\n",
        "This actually is a crucial concept, and we have three evaluation options to choose from:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   **Precision** - High precision means that the model does not give many **\"False Positives\"**. \n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Recall** High Recall means that model has a very low proportion of **\"False Negatives\"**. \n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **F1 Score** The F1 Score is a balance between Precision and Recall, this a great  measure for overall accuracy. \n",
        "\n",
        "Which of these metrics are most important to pay attention to? Well, this wholly depends on your context and what type of error is most costly to your business. Here we need to analyse the consequence of each type of error.\n",
        "\n",
        "If, for example a **false positive** is very very costly, such as in the case of Face Recognition or Mortgage Approval, then we will want to maximise the **Precision** metric as much as possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, if getting a false negative is even more problematic, as for example in cases such as Fraud Detection or Cancer Diagnosis, then we'll make sure our model has the highest **Recall** measure possible. \n",
        "\n",
        "If obtaining a false negative is just as bad as a false positive and there is no difference between them, then we can simply use the **F1 score**. \n",
        "\n",
        "Remember there is no right or wrong answer here because it is a judgment call based on your own individual context.\n",
        "\n",
        "So let's go back to our own specific case and decide which is the most costly. Imagine, we wrongly thought that a customer was about to Churn when in fact he/she had no intention in doing so ( **false positive**), the worst case scenario would be that we gave them an unnecessary discount.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, if we failed to identify that a customer was about to churn ( **false negative**), then the consequences are a lot bleaker: the customer can move to the competition. It is well known that in telecommunications, the LTV ( Life Time Value) is high ( in the case of Telco, our data informs us that it is around **$2,500** per customer ! )  and so losing that customer will be extremely costly and getting  them back will be very lengthy.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is indeed a pretty clear case where having a false negative error is a lot more problematic than a false positive, so we'd rather have a model that produces very few **false negatives** (even if that means that it will make more **false positives**). Therefore, we'll use **Recall** as our evaluation metric.\n",
